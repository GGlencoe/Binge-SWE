# Binge — Food Discovery App

An interactive food discovery platform where users swipe through restaurant and recipe suggestions that adapt to their personal tastes.

## Repository Structure

```
Binge-SWE/
└── my-app/      # Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase)
```

## Core Idea

Most food discovery platforms rely on manual searching. Binge introduces a **discovery-first approach**: users swipe through curated food cards and the system learns from their reactions.

The platform adapts to:
- Likes / skips / super-likes
- Dietary restrictions and allergies
- Cuisine preferences
- Past activity
